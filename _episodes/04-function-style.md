# Editing function to our package
Let's look at one of the functions in our package. Open your `molecool/functions.py` module in a text editor. The function `open_pdb` reads coordinates and atom symbols from a pdb file.

~~~
def open_pdb(f_loc):
    with open(f_loc) as f:
        data = f.readlines()
    c = []
    sym = []
    for l in data:
        if 'ATOM' in l[0:6] or 'HETATM' in l[0:6]:
            sym.append(l[76:79].strip())
            c2 = [float(x) for x in l[30:55].split()]
            c.append(c2)
    coords = np.array(c)
    return sym, coords
~~~
{: .language-python}

If we want to test our function, we require a pdb file. The workshop materials downloaded during the setup include a set of pdb examples. These are found in `molssi_beter_practices/starting_material/data/pdb/`. We want to store these files in our molecool directory. Luckily, cookicutter created a folder designed specifically for that purpose. The folder is in `molecool/data/`. This folder can contain any data useful for testing of the basic functionality of our code. Be mindful given that this folder is also downloaded when installing our package, so do not include data whose size is significant. 

Go ahead and copy the pdb files in a new folder `pdb` inside the data folder. With the files in our molecool folder, we can access the function when we execute it in the interactive Python interpreter. Test this by opening the interactive Python interpreter and typing the following

~~~
>>> import os
>>> from molecool.io import open_pdb
>>> pdb_file = os.path.join('molecool', 'data', 'pdb', 'water.pdb')
>>> symbols, coords = open_pdb(pdb_file)
>>> symbols
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
['O', 'H', 'H']
~~~
{: .output}

You should get a list of atomic symbols of the water molecule from executing this code.
You can also see the atomic coordinates by executing:
~~~
>>> coords
~~~
{: .language-python}

You should get a numpy array of atomic coordinates.

~~~
array([[ 9.626,  6.787, 12.673],
       [ 9.626,  8.42 , 12.673],
       [10.203,  7.604, 12.673]])
~~~
{: .output}

Hooray! It seems like this function works! This should come as no surprise since we are the authors of the function and we know its internal structure. This is not necessarily true for someone editing our code and specially not true for someone just using our code. There are instances where even though the code is executed correctly, i.e., there where no syntax errors, an unwanted expected behavior occurs. In these cases, our code should be able to stop itself to prevent a malfunction. 

## Raising Errors 

Take for example the division by zero. If we try to calculate 
~~~
>>> 1/0
~~~
{: .language-python}

We would get

~~~
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
~~~
{: .output}

In this example, the code was smart enough to identify the division by zero and halted. This type of feedback is much more helpful than just throwing an ugly `NaN`. This is called an exception error. There are several built-in exception such as the "ZeroDivisionError", but in general one can simply use a `raise Exception`. Let us see how we could accomplish this. 

Consider our function `calculate_distance`

~~~
def calculate_distance(rA, rB):
    d=(rA-rB)
    dist=np.linalg.norm(d)
    return dist
~~~
{: .language-python}

The function returns a distance no mater what the two points are. Now, imagine that an xyz file contained a repeated line, our function would do its job and print a distance equal to `0.0`. This is clearly unphysical and could lead into plotting two atoms in the same point. This is a perfect place to raise an exception. The syntax is as follows

~~~
def calculate_distance(rA, rB):
    d=(rA-rB)
    dist=np.linalg.norm(d)
    if dist == 0.0:
        raise Exception("Two atoms are located in the same point in space")
    return dist
~~~
{: .language-python}

In this way, trying to calculate the distance between the same two points would now show

~~~
Exception: Two atoms are located in the same point in space
~~~
{: .output}

This is a general exception that requires a very explicit line to describe what the problem is. The already built-in exceptions include errors that are common while programming. For example, our function requires explicit use of numpy arrays. Nevertheless, a user may be tempted to use a list of length 3 to describe the position of two atoms. We know that it is not possible to perform arithmetic between full lists. In this case we might use the exception type `TypeError`

~~~
def calculate_distance(rA, rB):
    if isinstance(rA,np.ndarray) is False or isinstance(rB,np.ndarray) is False:
        raise TypeError("rA and rB must be numpy arrays")
    d=(rA-rB)
    dist=np.linalg.norm(d)
    if dist == 0.0:
        raise Exception("Two atoms are located in the same point in space")
    return dist
~~~
{: .language-python}

If we try to use lists instead of numpy arrays, our function then would stop and print 

~~~
TypeError: rA and rB must be numpy arrays
~~~
{: .output}

With the built-in exception, we would immediately know that the error is related to the type of input we are giving to the function.

Other types of common exceptions include variables not being defined (NameError) or asserting that two numbers are the same (assert). The latter will be particularly useful when we want to automatize testing within our package. 

## Coding Style

Our functions are now smarter and will better guide users while using them. However, our function still might be hard to read and understand for others so we might want to consider styling it properly.

As a developer, you spend a lot of time thinking about writing your code. However, code is read much more often than it is written. Following a style guide will help others (and perhaps you in the future!) to read your code.

For Python, the common convention for code style is called [PEP8]. PEP8 is a document that gives guidelines for best practices in Python coding style. PEP8 is a recommendation, not rule. However, you should follow this convention when possible.

> ## Python PEP
>
> If you spend a lot of time programming in Python, you will see references to PEPs a lot. PEP stands for "Python Enhancement Proposal". These are design documents which provide information about features. PEPs come from the Python community, meaning anyone can author a PEP (however, there is a strict review process). PEPs are classified into three categories - standards, informational, or process.
>
> You can read more about PEPs in [Python's documentation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/). PEP1 outlines what a PEP is and how they work.
{: .callout}

PEP8 tells us several things about styling that will make our code easier to read. Let's consider some of these and how they might change our function.

## Variable names
PEP8 recommends that

> Never use the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
 
> Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

Though not specifically reference in PEP8, we also recommend making all variable names descriptive so that someone reading your code can easily understand what the variable is. 

Consider a few variable we have defined in our function (`c`, `sym`, `c2`, `l`). Is it clear what these are or mean? We can change them to be more descriptive and readable.

~~~
def open_pdb(file_location):
    with open(file_location) as f:
        data = f.readlines()
    coordinates = []
    symbols = []
    for line in data:
        if 'ATOM' in line[0:6] or 'HETATM' in line[0:6]:
            symbols.append(line[76:79].strip())
            atom_coords = [float(x) for x in line[30:55].split()]
            coordinates.append(atom_coords)
    coords = np.array(coordinates)
    return symbols, coords
~~~
{: .language-python}

For this rewrite of the function, we have made the following changes in variable names

- `f_loc`  ---> `file_location`
- `c` ---> `coordinates`
- `sym` ---> `symbols`
- `l` ---> `line`
- `c2` ---> `atom_coords`

These variable names follow PEP8 convention and are much more descriptive and readable. 

## Indentation

PEP8 indicates that indentation should be 4 spaces per indentation level. Our code meets this criteria.

## Whitespace

> Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.), comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <>, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not), Booleans (and, or, not).

This means that every time we have an expression assigning a variable, it should be `variable = value` instead of `variable=value`.

You can also use whitespace to separate ideas within a function or code.

> Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

Using these rules, our function becomes

~~~
def open_pdb(file_location):
    
    with open(file_location) as f:
        data = f.readlines()

    coordinates = []
    symbols = []
    for line in data:
        if 'ATOM' in line[0:6] or 'HETATM' in line[0:6]:
            symbols.append(line[76:79].strip())
            atom_coords = [float(x) for x in line[30:55].split()]
            coordinates.append(coords)

    coords = np.array(coordinates)
    symbols = np.array(symbols)

    return symbols, coords
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now that we've written a new function in our project, we should commit our changes and push to GitHub.

~~~
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "add open_pdb function to molecool"
$ git push origin master
~~~
{: .bash}



> ## Exercise
> Below is the `calculate_distance` function that takes two points in 3D space and returns the distance between them. Even though it works just fine, the variable names are not very clear and it doesn't follow PEP8 styling. Take a couple of minutes to reformat this function in `molecool/functions.py` module.
> ~~~
> def calculate_distance(rA, rB):
>     if isinstance(rA,np.ndarray) is False or isinstance(rB,np.ndarray) is False:
>         raise TypeError("rA and rB must be numpy arrays")
>     d=(rA-rB)
>     dist=np.linalg.norm(d)
>     if dist == 0.0:
>         raise Exception("Two atoms are located in the same point in space")
>     return dist
> ~~~
>> ## Solution
>> Here is a better formatted version of `calculate_distance` which is easier to read and understand.

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Now we've successfully styled function according to PEP8! However, if we compare what we've written above to the sample function, `canvas`, we notice that ours is a little different.

Keeping your previous Python interpreter open, type the following:

~~~
import molecool as mc
help(mc.canvas)
~~~

**Note: Do not use `help(mc.canvas())`, this will actually execute your code (not what we want).**

The code above calls Python's built-in function, `help`. For our canvas function, it displays the multi-line comment (called a `docstring`), that is written beneath the function definition.

~~~
Help on function canvas in module molecool.functions:

canvas(with_attribution=True)
    Placeholder function to show example docstring (NumPy format)

    Replace this function and doc string for your own project

    Parameters
    ----------
    with_attribution : bool, Optional, default: True
        Set whether or not to display who the quote is from

    Returns
    -------
    quote : str
        Compiled string including quote and optional attribution
~~~
{: .output}

If we try the same thing on our `calculate_distance` function, we don't get a helpful message.

We will want to write a docstring for our new `calculate_distance` function. This way, it will be clear to new developers who use our code what the function does, and be accessible to any users using the function interactively. Returning, to the `functions.py` module file, edit your `calculate_distance` function to look like the following:

~~~
def calculate_distance(rA, rB):
    """Calculate the distance between two points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rA, rB : np.ndarray
        The coordinates of each point.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : float
        The distance between the two points.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> r1 = np.array([0, 0, 0])
    >>> r2 = np.array([0, 0.1, 0])
    >>> calculate_distance(r1, r2)
    0.1
    """

    if isinstance(rA,np.ndarray) is False or isinstance(rB,np.ndarray) is False:
        raise TypeError("rA and rB must be numpy arrays")

    dist_vec = (rA - rB)
    distance = np.linalg.norm(dist_vec)
    
    if distance == 0.0:
        raise Exception("Two atoms are located in the same point in space")
        
    return distance

    
~~~
{: .language-python}


## Docstrings
We've now added a multi-line comment (called a `docstring`, short for "documentation string"), to the beginning of our function. Docstrings **are the first statement after a function or module definition** and are opened and closed with three quotes.

The docstring should explain what the function or module does (and not how it is done).

> ## The `__doc__` attribute
>
> When you add a docstring to a function or module, python automatically adds this to the `__doc__` attribute of the object.
>
> You can also see an object's docstring by typing `object.__doc__` into the Python interpreter. For example, to see the docstring associated with the canvas function, `molecool.canvas.__doc__` into the Python interpreter (after importing `molecool`, of course.)
{: .callout}

### Sections of a Docstring
There are many ways you could format this docstring (different styles/conventions). We recommend using [numpy style docstrings], and this is what the example above and `calculate_distance` function are written in.

Each docstring has a number of sections which are separated by headings. Headings should be underlined with hyphens (`-----`). There are many options for sections, we will only cover the most relevant here. If you would like to see a full list, check out the documentation for [numpy style docstrings].

#### 1. Short summary
A one-line summary that does not use the variable name or the function name. In our `calculate_distance` function, this corresponds to the following.

~~~
"""
Calculate the distance between two points.
"""
~~~
{: .language-python}

#### 2. Extended summary
A few sentences giving a detailed description of the function or module. This section should be used to clarify *functionality*, not to discuss implementation.

We do not have an extended summary in our `calculate_distance` function, since it is relatively straightforward.

#### 3. Parameters
This section contains a description of the function arguments - keywords and expected types.

The parameters for our `calculate_distance` function is shown below:

~~~
"""
Parameters
----------
rA, rB : np.ndarray
    The coordinates of each point.
"""
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here, you can see that the parameter section begins with the section title ("Parameters"), followed by a line of hypens ("----"). On the next line, we have the argument names (`rA, rB`), then a colon followed by the input type of the argument. This line says that the arguments `rA` and `rB` should be of type `np.ndarray`. The next line gives a more detailed description of the variable. When the input parameters are of different type or they aren't related to each other they should be written on a new line.

#### 4. Returns
This section is very similar to the `Parameters` section above. In contrast to the `Parameters` section, each returned value does not have to be named, but the type of the return value is required.

For our `calculate_distance` function, our `Returns` section looks like the following.

~~~
"""
Returns
-------
distance : float
    The distance between the two points.
"""
~~~
{: .language-python}

#### 5. Examples
This is an optional section to show examples of functionality. This section is meant to illustrate usage. Though this section is optional, its use is strongly encouraged.

Consider the example we have in our docstring

~~~
"""
Examples
--------
>>> r1 = np.array([0, 0, 0])
>>> r2 = np.array([0, 0.1, 0])
>>> calculate_distance(r1, r2)
0.1
"""
~~~
{: .language-python}

It is important that your Examples in docstrings be working Python. We will see in the `testing` lesson how we can run automatic tests on our docstrings, and in the `documentation` lesson, we will see how we can display examples in documentation to our users. 

We have three lines of code for our example. In examples, lines of code begin with `>>>`. The first two lines define numpy arrays that are used in our `calculate_distance` function. Note that `r1` and `r2` must be numpy arrays (as indicated by our `Parameters` section), or our Example will not give valid Python code (our function would error if we ran it). On the last line, you give the output (with no `>>>` in front.)

Now that we've written a function in our project, we should commit our changes and push to GitHub.

~~~
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "edit style of calculate_distance function"
$ git push origin master

## More on Coding Style

If you look at PEP8, you will see that it is quite long. While you should definitely read it if you spend a lot of time programming in Python, there are luckily tools which will help us make sure our code is following PEP8 convention. We will use [yapf], an open source formatter for Python files from Google.

Install yapf using pip. In your terminal, type

~~~
$ pip install yapf
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now we can use yapf on our python files. Just to see the power of yapf, let's mangle one of our functions and use yapf to reformat it.

~~~
def calculate_distance(rA, rB):
          """
    Calculate the distance between two points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rA, rB : np.ndarray
        The coordinates of each point.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : float
        The distance between the two points.
          """
          dist_vec = (rA - rB)
          distance = np.linalg.norm(dist_vec)
          return distance
~~~
{: .language-python}

If you save the file and test your function in the command line, you will see that it still works when formated this way. However, it is significantly harder to read in the text editor. We can use yapf to format this automatically. In your terminal, run yapf with the following command -

~~~
$ yapf -i molecool/functions.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Here, the `-i` flag indicates to do this "in-place", this means your file will be overwritten with yapf's changes. If you examine the file after running yapf, you should see that it is returned to an easily readable format.

> ## yapf settings
>
> CookieCutter created some settings for yapf for us when we ran it. In the file `setup.cfg` in the top level directory.
>
> ~~~
>[yapf]
>COLUMN_LIMIT = 119
>INDENT_WIDTH = 4
>USE_TABS = False
> ~~~
> This section overwrites some default parameters for yapf. You can change this to your preferences.
{: .callout}

Now that we've written a function in our project, we should commit our changes and push to GitHub.
