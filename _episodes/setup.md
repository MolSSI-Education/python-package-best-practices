# Set Up

Participation in the MolSSI Best Practices Workshop will require using your own personal computer or laptop and installing some software.

```{admonition} Windows users take note
:class: attention

If you are working on a Windows computer, 
participation in this workshop will require you to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
You should install WSL 2, you will need to have the Windows 10 or Windows 11 OS with the following version requirements:

* For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher.
* For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher.  

If you haven't updated your computer in a while, 
these updates could take a considerable amount of time. 
Plan accordingly!

If you are on Windows 11, you can also [set up WSL to be able to use graphical interfaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps).
```

Please follow the instructions given here to make sure you have the necessary software installed. 
We will be using Python and the conda package manager. 
If you are on MacOS, Linux, or WSL and you already have Anaconda (or Miniconda) installed,
skip to the environment creation portion of these set-up instructions. 
If you do not have Anaconda or Miniconda installed please see the appropriate section below. 
**Note** If you are on Windows Miniconda has to be installed on WSL (not Windows). 
This might be a separate installation.

```{admonition} Anaconda vs. Minconda
:class: info

Anaconda is a distribution of Python, the conda package manager, and several third-party libraries that are commonly used in data science.
Miniconda contains only Python and the conda package manager. You will be able to install any package you would like later using Miniconda. 
Miniconda will take up a lot less space on your computer.
We will be learning to manage conda environments and install the packages we need, so we consider Miniconda to be the better option between the two.
If you already have Anaconda installed, however, there is no need to install Miniconda.
```

## Installing WSL (Windows users only)
If your computer uses the Windows operating system, we require installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 
Follow the installation instructions at [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 
If you don’t have a preference for Linux distribution, we recommend installing Ubuntu 20.04. 

Once WSL is installed, open your ‘Start’ menu and choose ‘Ubuntu’. 
This will open a terminal window. 
A terminal is an interface you can use to interact with your computer using text.
The first time you open Ubuntu, you may see a message which says “Installing, this may take a few minutes…”. 
After the installation is done, you will have to create a username and password. 
After these are created, you should be able to use the terminal.

The Windows Subsystem for Linux is like running another computer inside your computer. 
It is a different operating system with different software installed than your Windows computer. 
For the WSL, you have to install Miniconda from the terminal in your Linux operating system. 
Note that if you are using the WSL, 
your Linux OS is completely separated from your Windows operating system. 
This means that software installed on one operating system is not available on the other. 
If you are running the Windows 11 operating system, 
you can [set up WSL to use graphical interfaces on your computer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps). 
Otherwise, you will only be able to interact with WSL through the terminal (and the text editor VSCode, 
see later in the set-up for information on how to use VS Code in WSL).

## Miniconda Installation
You can install Miniconda through a graphical interface or using your terminal. 
Pick either "Graphical Installation" or "Text-based (terminal) Installation". 
**If you are using WSL, it may be easiest to complete this using the terminal installation.**

### Graphical Installation
Obtain the latest version of Miniconda for your OS at this [link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 
This will download an installer you can run to install Miniconda on your system. 
Note that if you are using WSL, you will need the **Linux** installer, 
and you will have to move this file to WSL before running. 

### Text-based (terminal) Installation
You can also use the terminal to download and install the Miniconda compilers using the terminal. 
If you are using Linux or WSL, type the following into your terminal.

````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
````

If you are using a Mac, you should pick the appropriate link for your architecture from the Miniconda installer page.

M1: https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh  
x86: https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

After installation, 
close and reopen your terminal window. 
If you do not see `(base)` before your username on the command line, type


````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
conda init
```
````

### Set conda to use the libmamba solver
The libmamba solver is an optional replacement to the default conda solver.
The libmamba solver will handle dependency solving much faster than the default solver.
To use the libmamba solver, first ensure your conda is up to date.
````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
conda update -n base conda
```
````

Then install the libmamba solver into your base environment.
````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
```
````

Finally, set the default solver to be the libmamba solver.
````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
conda config --set solver libmamba
```
````

```{admonition} Using Mamba instead of Conda
:class: attention
If desired, instead of using a miniconda installation with the libmamba solver, you can directly use Mamba or Micromamba.
Installation instructions can be found in Mamba's documentation: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
If using a version of mamba instead of conda, simply replace `conda` in all following instructions with `mamba`.
```

## Creating a conda environment

A `conda` environment contains a specific collection of packages you have installed.
This means that packages are isolated, and installed only for a specific environment -- you can have several environments each with different installed packages, or different versions of installed packages in different environments.

It's considered a best practice to create a new Python environment for each project you work on.

This section uses the command line interface (CLI), or terminal, to create an environment using `conda`.
If you are on Mac or Linux, you will type these commands into your terminal. 
If you are on Windows, you will use WSL. 

To create an environment for this project using `conda`,

````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
conda create --name molssi_best_practices "python=3.11"
```
````

For other projects, you should replace `molssi_best_practices` with a descriptive name for your project.
`conda` also allows you to specify the Python version to use with the environment.
Here, `python=3.11` specifies that we want to use Python 3.11 in this environment.
Executing this command will list the environment location and a list of Python packages to be installed.
Choose `y(es)` when prompted.

Activate the environment using the command

````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
conda activate molssi_best_practices
```
````

To see a list of all your environments,

````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
conda info --envs
```
````

To deactivate an environment, type

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ conda deactivate
```
````


You can use `conda` to create environments with different Python versions. 
You might be able to see how this could be useful for running old code 
(you can change `3.11` in the command above to any version you want),
or testing your code in different Python versions.

### Package installation using conda
Using `conda`, we can install packages to our environments.
**Note**: Make sure you have activated the environment where you want to install packages.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ conda activate molssi_best_practices
```
````


To list all the Python packages installed in an environment, first activate it, then type

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ conda list
```
````


Packages can be installed using the `conda install package_name` command.
For example, to install NumPy (do not execute this, we will install NumPy later),

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ conda install numpy
```
````


Further, the desired version of NumPy can be specified by adding this following the package name.
For example, if you wanted to install NumPy version 1.15: `conda install numpy=1.15`

For this workshop, you will need to install the following packages into your environment
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- JupyterLab

Packages available to Conda are stored within `channels`.
Some packages are not stored in the default Conda channel, so we need to specify where Conda can find the package with `-c` followed by a channel name in our installation command.
We will install all of our packages from the `conda-forge` channel, 
so we include the syntax `-c conda-forge` in our installation command.

You can install multiple libraries at the same time by listing them one after another.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ conda install -c conda-forge numpy matplotlib jupyterlab
```
````



## CookieCutter Installation <a name="cookiecutter"></a>

For this workshop, we will create the structure of our Python package using the [CMS CookieCutter].
Please have this package installed **in your `molssi_best_practices` environment**.

First, switch to your environment for this workshop if you are not in it.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ conda activate molssi_best_practices
```
````


Install the general cookiecutter with the following commands.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```
````



## Installing and configuring git

### Installation
We will be using the `git` software for version control during this workshop. 
This portion walks you through installing and configuring `git`.

If you do not have the environment activated, activate it first:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
conda activate molssi_best_practices
```
````


Next, make sure you have git installed.

You can check if git is installed using the following command in your terminal:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
git --version
```
````


Make sure that this outputs at least version 2.28. 
If you do not have git installed, or if it is an older version of git, 
you can install git using conda:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
conda install -c conda-forge git
```
````

Note that because of the solver that conda uses to decide which version of a package to install you may end up with a version that is < 2.28. 
You can use the same command from above `git --version` to see what version has been installed.

If the output of that command is < 2.28 you will want to use the following command to specify the version to install. 
Any version >=2.28 is acceptable.

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
conda install -c conda-forge git">=2.28"
```
````


### Configuring Git

The first time you use Git on a particular computer, you need to configure some things.

First, you should set your identity.
One of the most important things that version control like Git does is to keep track of who changes what.
This helps repository maintainers coordinate the efforts of all the people who contribute to the project.
Most importantly, it makes it easier to figure out who to blame when something goes wrong.
You can provide git your name and contact information with the following commands:

``` {admonition} Configuring git
:class: info 

In the command below, you do not need to put your name or your email address in all caps.
```

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
git config --global user.name "YOUR_FIRSTNAME YOUR_LASTNAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
```
````


Next, you will need to set the name of the default branch git uses.
The following command will set your default branch name to "main"

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
````


Next, you might want to change the Git text editor.
As we will see later, certain Git commands will open text files.
When this happens, Git will use your environment's default text editor, which might not be the editor you are most comfortable using.
Using configuration commands, you can tell Git to use your favorite editor.

We recommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your text editor in the last portion of this set-up.
Note that using VS Code on Windows or Mac requires additional set-up, which is outlined in the section ``Installing a text editor``.
To make VS Code your default editor for git, do

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
````


A more complete list of possible editors is available [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html).

You can check the configuration commands that you have set using:

````{tab-set-code} 

```{code-block} shell
$ git config --list
```
````


## GitHub

If you do not yet have a GitHub account, you will need to create one.
To create an account, navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/), and click "Sign up". 
When creating your GitHub username, remember that this is a professional profile where you can showcase your work.
Keeping this in mind, make sure that your GitHub username is both **professional** and **recognizable**.

### GitHub Credentials
We will be using the command line interface for GitHub. 
GitHub *very recently* deprecated using a username and password from the command line.
Instead, you will need to create something called an ssh key to verify your account.

Follow the [instructions given by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to create an SSH key and add it to your account.

## Text Editor
Everyone should have a text editor they can use to edit code. 
If you do not have a preference for text editors, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
If you are using WSL, see [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) for installing Visual Studio Code for use with WSL.
If you are using Mac, follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#:~:text=Launching%20from%20the%20command%20line,code'%20command%20in%20PATH%20command.) to set-up VS Code so that you can use it from the command line.

You should also install the [Microsoft Python Extension Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for VSCode.
When enabled, the Python extension will allow you to set the Python environment that VS Code will use to run static checks of your code. 
You can set the Python environment when you have a Python project open by clicking the Python version (will likely be 3.something) on
in the blue ribbon at the bottom of the editor on the right. 
Select the `molssi-best-practices` environment.

## Downloading Workshop Materials<a name="materials_download"></a>

In this workshop, we will be moving code from a Jupyter Notebook into a Python package that we can install and import into other scripts.

- {download}`Starting materials for lesson <../data/starting_material.zip>`.

``````{admonition} Downloading materials from the command line
:class: tip

If you are on WSL or would like to use the command line, you can download the workshop materials using `curl` 
(similar to how you downloaded the Miniconda installer)

````{tab-set-code}
```{code-block} shell URL_HERE
curl -O -L https://github.com/MolSSI-Education/python-package-best-practices/raw/main/data/starting_material.zip
```
````

``````

- Create a folder called `molssi_best_practices` and add the file you downloaded from the step above.
- The file you download as starting materials will be a `zip` file.
  You should unzip this file into the folder you have created. (On the command line, you can type `unzip data.zip`)
  After downloading and unzipping, verify that you see the following directory structure.
    ~~~
    molssi_best_practices
    └── starting_material  
            ├── data
            │   ├── pdb
            │   │   ├── 1bna.pdb
            │   │   ├── benzene.pdb
            │   │   └── water.pdb
            │   └── xyz
            │       ├── 1bna.xyz
            │       ├── benzene.xyz
            │       └── water.xyz
            └── starting_notebook.ipynb
    ~~~

## Conclusion
At the end of this set-up, you should have created a Python environment (`molssi_best_practices`) which has Python 3.11, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter`, and `cookiecutter` installed.

You should also have downloaded starting material, installed and created an account on GitHub, and configured Git.
