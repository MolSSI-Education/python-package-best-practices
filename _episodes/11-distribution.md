This lesson will discuss how to distribute packages through the Python Package Index (PyPI) and conda. 

# Preliminary

Register a test account on test.pypi.org.

[Create](https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens) an [access token](https://test.pypi.org/help/#apitoken), and *don't lose it!*
(I keep a copy of the text for my token in my password manager.)

The access token will be a string that begins with `pypi-` followed by a sequence of base64 encoded bytes.
We will refer to the full string as "YOURTOKEN" below.

Create `$HOME/.pypirc`. It should look something like the following, substituting your access token in the password field.

~~~
[testpypi]
  username = __token__
  password = YOURTOKEN
~~~
{: .output}

You will also eventually need to [get an account](https://pypi.org/account/register/) on the main pypi.org,
but you can do that later.

Install some additional packages to help build and upload your distribution.
~~~
pip install build twine
~~~
{: .language-bash}

# Preparing a release

## Release notes

Make sure your README file and documentation are up to date.
Check the project description in your project's metadata, too.

Consider whether there is some announcement text that you would
want to include in a text file or in a blurb in your GitHub
[Releases tab](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases).
This can be a good place to publish [release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes).


## Tagging the release

~~~
git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Make sure that your changes are checked in and that you don't have
extra files sitting around.

Tag the latest commit with a version identifier.
Let's get ready to publish `molecool` 1.0.0a1, the first alpha release of our package.
~~~
git tag 1.0.0a1
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Build the distribution archive(s) for the packaging system you are using (see below): `PyPI` or `Conda`.

> ## Synchronizing tags
> 
> Tags created in your local repository are not automatically shared when you `git push` a branch.
You can push tags the same way you push branches, or you can create the tag directly on GitHub.
With the GitHub interface, you can associate tags with
[Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
to provide a place to publish release notes and automatically generate links to archive files of
your repository at the tagged commits.
>
> Tags created through the GitHub interface (or pushed from a different location) will be available
locally the next time you `git fetch`.
>
> Keep in mind that the GitHub repository page is one of the main entry points for new users of your package.
Your project looks healthier and better maintained with a nice, well documented history of
> [releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags).
{: .callout}

Tags and GitHub releases do not automatically make your package easier to find or install,
but they can be helpful in preparing the source of version information or the source archive
as you prepare the *distribution* of your package.

# Packages and distributions

A "distribution" is a collection of files including one (or more) Python packages that have been made portable and ready to share.

The cookiecutter template provided several additional files and metadata
to help you get your package ready for distribution,
such as the `LICENSE` file, `MANIFEST.in`, `setup.cfg`, and `pyproject.toml`.

Some of these files are essential details to make your distribution
portable or discoverable.
Others are specific to the build system (e.g. `setuptools` or `conda`).

The build system is responsible for assembling your files into a distribution
archive that can be easily placed into anyone's `site-packages` directory.
It also makes sure that various package metadata is assembled so that a
package installer like `pip` can evaluate software dependencies, and so that
your package looks good when it is shared, such as on pypi.org.

## Distributing packages for `pip install`
* Packaging standards: [Python Packaging Authority](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/)
* Build system: `setuptools`
* Distribution network: pypi.org

### Building the distribution

We previously mentioned that `pip install .` invokes `setuptools` to build the
distribution archive for our package before installing the package in our
environment.
What does this mean?
More importantly, what does it have to do with letting other people do
`pip install molecool` and get my package automatically downloaded from
"the cloud"?

Setuptools is not the only package for configuring and building Python
distribution archives,
but it is what we will tell `pip` to use for this project.
When `pip install` is run on package sources, it notices the `pyproject.toml` file (which marks a folder as containing
buildable packages),
launches the configured build system, and then installs the resulting "wheel" (distribution archive).
Note that, if we _only_ want to prepare a distribution for sharing,
we can just use the `build` module.

~~~
pip install build
python -m build .
~~~
{: .language-bash}


Note the version string embedded in the distribution archive name.
`versioningit` (configured in `pyproject.toml`) also participated in the build process.
`versioningit` generated a `_version.py` file with a version string derived
from your most recent `git` tag. We will not add this file to our `git`
revision control, but it will be packaged in our distribution.
`versioningit` will regenerate this file as necessary and appropriate.

Note that the untagged post-release version strings
(using our formatting rules in `pyproject.toml`)
do not satisfy PEP 440 and will be rejected if we try to upload to pypi.
This is probably a good thing; it will help keep us from accidentally publishing
releases before they are ready, or messing up our versioning scheme by forgetting
a semantic versioning tag.

> ## Goodbye to setup.py?
>
> Historically packages built with `setuptools` used a `setup.py` script
as the entry point to the `setuptools` build system. `setup.py` is specific
to `setuptools` and the `distutils` package it is built on.
Many tools for helping to build and test packages came to
rely on `setup.py`, which made them incompatible with non-setuptools build
systems.
> 
> In an ongoing effort at generalization, the Python community is now
encouraging package authors to use a `pyproject.toml` file to direct the build
system. `distutils` is scheduled for retirement with Python 3.12.
In preparation, `setuptools` no longer requires `distutils` or `setup.py`,
and can be configured entirely with `pyproject.toml`.

### Building and uploading to PyPI

Read through https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
for a build-system-agnostic tutorial on
* packaging Python projects for distribution
* publishing packages to pypi.org for automatic download with `pip install`

By the end of the [tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/),
you will understand how to get an account on `pypi.org`,
build a distribution archive with `python -m build`,
and use twine to upload your package.

The [tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) should go quickly because,
as you will note, most of the configuration it describes
has already been pre-configured by the cookiecutter.
Caution: *strongly* consider creating an account on `test.pypi.org` and uploading
an initial "alpha" or "beta" release of your package to see how it looks and to
do test installations.

Note that pypi.org enforces universal uniqueness of packages and versions.
Once you have uploaded `molecool` version `1.0.0`, you cannot replace it;
you can only upload additional versions. (You can "yank" a release, but this
only marks the package as "yanked", indicating it should not be used.
It is still out there.)
* Be tidy with your official releases.
* Be conservative with alpha and beta pre-releases.
* Test the publication of new releases on test.pypi.org before pypi.org to avoid
  cluttering your versioning scheme and your release history on pypi.

see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/


## Distributing packages for `conda install`

`conda` has a completely different approach to building and distributing
packages, and is not yet PEP-517 compliant.
(It does not use `pyproject.toml`.)
For fundamental information about using `conda build`
(such as preparing your build details and metadata with `meta.yml`),
see [conda-build docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/).
For documentation on publishing packages through the `conda-forge` channel,
refer to the channel's [contribution docs](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html).

# Preparing for future releases
 
Consider adding or updating a CHANGELOG.

## Version specifiers

Python has a strict syntax for version strings.

* Refer to [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) for constraints on Python version specifiers.
* Know how to mark versions for pre-release (or post-release) and consider
  tagging "alpha" and "beta" releases.
  
## Versioning semantics

Refer to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) for guidelines on how to use versions meaningfully.

Once your package has outside users, consider how your changes affect
your users.
Avoid surprising your users by effectively supporting the package manager heuristics
(e.g. use prerelease version semantics to make a version only available when `pip install --pre` is used).
Make sure your version increments reflect the compatibilty changes
in the distributions you release.

Making these considerations may lead you to moderate the changes you make.
For instance, instead of completely changing an interface,
consider introducing a new function or module with a different name.
Or provide backwards compatible support for the old interfaces.
