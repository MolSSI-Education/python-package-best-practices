From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), continuous integration (CI) is the practice of
merging all developers' working copies of code to a shared mainline, several times a day. In other words, CI refers to
the coupling of version control and unit testing in an automated way. Typically, CI runs either when you commit new code
to your project, or beforehand, when you try to merge experimental code into the main repository
(through a pull request). CI is useful not only for catching bugs before they reach your fellow developers and your end
users, but also for expanding your testing to platforms that are not available to you.

Most CI services are tightly integrated with GitHub. In this episode, we will be
using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions), because it is tightly integrated with
GitHub and is free to use. Other options you might consider include [CircleCI](https://circleci.com)
, [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/), or
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/).

Using any of these services is essentially getting access to empty remote computers that we can configure as we wish. In
order to test our projects using Travis, we will have to set up the correct environment and tell our CI service what to
do.

## Setting up GitHub Actions

All of GitHub Actions' settings are stored in the file
`.github/workflows/CI.yaml`. Note the leading period on the `.github` folder, which makes this a hidden folder in Linux
and Mac OS. The `.github` file stores information which is relevant for GitHub in general. For example, you will also
see in this folder a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` which contains contributing guidelines (the information in this file
is displayed to someone when they contribute to your project). The file `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` is the file which
gives the template which users see when they open a pull request on your repository. If you wanted to change the
template or contributing text, you would do so by editing these files. Though not included with the cookiecutter, you
can also have
an [issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)
.

Workflows for GitHub Actions are in `.github/workflows` in yaml files. Fortunately for us, CookieCutter has created a
file for us (`CI.yaml`) and set it up to run our tests with pytest. GitHub has seen this folder and has actually been
running tests on our repository every time we push to GitHub. You might have noticed this, and you might have also
noticed that our tests are not passing on GitHub despite passing locally. We will address this soon. First, let's go
over the file `CI.yaml` in detail so you can understand what is happening under the hood.

So far in this workshop, we have been working in the `molecool/molecool` and
`molecool/tests` directories. We will now focus on the `CI.yaml` file, in the
`.github/workflows`, and on some other files in the `molecool/devtools`
directory.

First, open the `.github/workflows/CI.yaml` file. You will see something like the following at the top of the file:

~~~
name: CI

on:
  # GitHub has started calling new repo's first branch "main" https://github.com/github/renaming
  # Existing codes likely still have "master" as the primary branch
  # Both are tracked here to keep legacy and new codes working
  push:
    branches:
      - "master"
      - "main"
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "master"
      - "main"
  schedule:
    # Nightly tests run on master by default:
    #   Scheduled workflows run on the latest commit on the default or base branch.
    #   (from https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule)
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
~~~
{: .yml}

Before we continue, the configuration file is written in YAML and adheres to a set of
specifications. [YAML files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) they are very often used in software development as
configuration files. For each service that uses a YAML, the general structure of the YAML file follows a specific
format, but keywords will vary depending on the application. Keywords like `on`,
`schedule`, `push`, and `pull_request` are specific to GitHub Actions and indicate several steps of the entire CI
process. You can always refer to the
[documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
for a list of all the avaialble keywords and a more in-depth explanation of each one.

This first section of the file tells GitHub what events should trigger our workflows to run. In this input file, we are
specifying to run on pushes to the
"main" branch or to the "master" branch. This is intended by the cookiecutter authors to catch both "main" and "master"
since both are common as primary branches. If you wanted your CI to run on events to another branch, you would add the
name here.

GitHub Actions also allows you to run
workflows [on a schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onschedule)
. The cookiecutter has set our workflows up to run nightly at midnight using the
`cron` keyword. GitHub Actions allows you to specify schedules or intervals for running CI jobs.

Next, we will tell GHA what "jobs" we want to be part of our workflow. To specify a job, we will need to specify the
operating system on which the job will run, as well as other things like the Python version to use.

~~~
{% raw %}
jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on ${{ matrix.os }}, Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macOS-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: [3.7, 3.8, 3.9]
{% endraw %}
~~~
{: .yml}

In this section, we start specifying our jobs by using the "jobs" keyword. Next, we give the job an
[ID](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_id)
(our ID here is "test"). We are using a "matrix" strategy, meaning that the job
"test" will run many times with all combinations of variables indicated in our matrix. For our matrix, we are using two
keywords called `os` and
`python-version`. It should be noted that we have made these keyword names up. Adding keywords here with associated
values just means that these are available as variables in the rest of our workflow.

To use variables in your GHA workflow you use the syntax `${{ variable_name }}`. You will see we have used the variables
we defined in `matrix` in the job `name`
and to specify the operating system to run on `runs-on` keyword in this section. This is enough for us right now, but if
you would want to specify exactly which versions of the operative systems you wanted to run your tests on, you could!

Next, we tell GitHub Actions the `steps` which are part of our workflow. GitHub Actions are unique in that the CI is
made up of different steps. Steps may be custom code which you write, but, steps may also be modular, commonly used code
blocks which have been made available to the community. For example, many python projects will need to install miniconda
to run. GHA makes it possible for one person to write this step and share it, instead of everyone having to write their
own implmentation. Some steps in Actions are modular and can be moved between workflows. To see what this means, let's
look at our first step.

~~~
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
~~~

This starts our `steps` section. Steps in our workflow are indicated either with the `uses` keyword or with the `name`
keyword (will see next). If we use
`uses,`, we are using a modular step which someone else has written and made available on the GitHub Actions
Marketplace. It then says that it uses
"actions/checkout@v1". This is an action which checks out your project. You can see the
documentation [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout]. By specifying that this step uses the checkout action,
we don't have to write code to do the checkout ourself.

Next, we want to get some info about the build. This is a custom step, so we give it a `name` and then give the shell
commands we want.

~~~
{% raw %}
    - name: Additional info about the build
      shell: bash
      run: |
        uname -a
        df -h
        ulimit -a
{% endraw %}
~~~
{: .yml}

We then give this step a descriptive name. After we have checked out our code for CI, we run some bash commands to get
some information about our build.

Next, we set up miniconda. This is a common action which many people have to do in their workflows, so we've used an
action which is availabe on marketplace

~~~
{% raw %}
    # More info on options: https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda
    - uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        environment-file: devtools/conda-envs/test_env.yaml

        channels: conda-forge,defaults

        activate-environment: test
        auto-update-conda: false
        auto-activate-base: false
        show-channel-urls: true
{% endraw %}
~~~
{: .yml}

You can go to the [specified URL](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda) to read more about this action.
Important again to note is that the keywords given in this step are specific to this action. If we were setting this up
ourselves, we would have had to find the action, read the documentation, and set up the options for the action to
perform as we wanted. You will see we are specifying the python version as well as the environment file. This
environment file for testing is in our `devtools` folder, and we will return to it soon.

Before we discuss the rest of the steps, let's consider how you might have found this action if the cookiecutter did not
set it up for you. We've already mentioned the "marketplace" several times in this tutorial, so let's look at that.
Navigate to
(https://github.com/marketplace)[https://github.com/marketplace].

The GitHub Marketplace is a place you can find Actions and other apps which can be added to your repositories. If we are
using GitHub Actions and there is a task we are trying to achieve, it's a good idea to check the marketplace for it.
Let's find the miniconda action by searching the marketplace. Search for "set up miniconda" in the marketplace.

If you search for this, you will find the action that we used. You can click on it to see the documentation.

Since we're using a yaml file for our environment, let's look at this file. Open
`devtools/conda-envs/test_env.yaml` in your text editor.

~~~
name: test
channels:
dependencies:
    # Base depends
  - python
  - pip

    # Testing
  - pytest
  - pytest-cov
  - codecov

    # Pip-only installs
  #- pip:
  #  - codecov
~~~
{: .yml}

This is a yaml file just like our GitHub Action file (remember we said YAML is commonly used for configuration files).
This is a file which can be used to create a conda environment with specified packages. For this workshop, we created
our environment by typing the command into the terminal. This could be inconvenient or impossible to reproduce if we
have a lot of dependencies, so conda allows us to specify environments using a yaml file which can be passed on or
reused.

We can see that this file specifies what packages will be installed in this environment. There are the two base
dependencies, `python` and `pip`, followed by dependencies specific to unit testing: `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `codecov`.
The last few lines are commented out, but allow you to install certain packages via
`pip`, instead of `conda`. Sometimes, some dependencies are not available on any Conda channel but exist
on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

Next, we installed our package in our environment as a development install. We use `conda list` after to print the
details of the environment. This way, the installed packages will be in the GitHub Actions log file in case you need to
check it.

~~~
{% raw %}
- name: Install package

      # conda setup requires this special shell
      shell: bash -l {0}
      run: |
        python -m pip install . --no-deps
        conda list
{% endraw %}
~~~
{: .yml}

After our package is installed, we run the test:

~~~
{% raw %}
 - name: Run tests

   # conda setup requires this special shell
   shell: bash -l {0}

    run: |
      pytest -v --cov=molecool --cov-report=xml --color=yes molecool/tests/
{% endraw %}
~~~
{: .yml}

## Getting our CI to work

Unfortunately, our CI runs failed. To know more about why this was the case, we have to read the GitHub Action log
files. Click on one of the failing entries. The new page you will be redirected to has details about the job at the top
and then the contents of the log file underneath. Look for red lines that indicate errors in your build.

Our tests failed because `numpy` could not be imported. When we set up the dependencies, we did not explicitly write
either `numpy` or `matplotlib`. As such, when Travis creates and configures the machines where our CI runs, these
packages are never installed. We need to add them to the
`devtools/conda-envs/test_env.yaml` file.

> ## Exercise
> Add two lines to the `test_env.yaml` specifying `numpy` and `matplotlib` as dependencies that should be installed
> in our CI environment.
>> ## Solution
>> Your `test_env.yaml` should look like this once you are done with your edits:
>>
>> ~~~
>> name: test
>> channels:
>> dependencies:
>>    # Base depends
>>  - python
>>  - pip
>>
>>  # Package dependencies
>>  - numpy
>>  - matplotlib
>>
>>    # Testing
>>  - pytest
>>  - pytest-cov
>>  - codecov
>>
>>    # Pip-only installs
>>  #- pip:
>>  #  - codecov
>> ~~~
>> {: .yml}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

After these edits, commit and push to the repository. GitHub will now detect a new commit and will start a new build
automatically. On your GitHub repository, click the Actions tab to see a new CI build running. After a minute or two,
you should see green checkmarks next to your build jobs. Congratulations! GitHub Actions is now set up and tracking your
repository.

This repository is just for demonstration, so we probably do not want to actually waste resources running these tests
every 24 hours. Go to your
`CI.yaml` file and remove the scheduled jobs. You should remove the schedule keyword from your YAML file, so that
the `on` section matches below:

~~~
name: CI

on:
  # GitHub has started calling new repo's first branch "main" https://github.com/github/renaming
  # Existing codes likely still have "master" as the primary branch
  # Both are tracked here to keep legacy and new codes working
  push:
    branches:
      - "master"
      - "main"
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "master"
      - "main"
~~~
{: .yml}

## Code Coverage - Part II

In the previous episode, we introduced the concept of code coverage as a measure of how much of our code is run by our
unit tests. Projects should aim for a high coverage percentage, but not obsess over the number. Remember that even if
your project has 100% coverage, it does not mean it is actually bug-free.

When we run `pytest`, we can get a summary of our coverage with the
`--cov=molecool` option. While this summary is helpful, it would be much more useful to know _which_ lines are covered
by our tests. In the following section, we will explore two methods that allow us to do just that.

### Assessing code coverage locally

Besides coverage summaries, the `pytest-cov` module can also produce details reports. Run the following command at the
root of your project to generate a report in HTML format:

~~~
$ pytest -v --cov=molecool --cov-report=html
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This command runs the tests as normal and in addition, creates a folder
`htmlcov` that contains web pages highlighting the lines on each of our files that are covered by tests. Go ahead and
open the file `htmlcov/index.html` on your web browser.

<br />
<center><img src="../fig/08_CI/pytestcov_reporthtml.png"></center>
<br />

The report page shows all the modules in your project, along with the number of lines (statements). More importantly, it
lists how many of these lines are not covered by tests (missing) as well as the coverage percentage. These percentages
depends on how you wrote your functions and your tests, so don't worry if those of the image above are slightly
different.

Click on the `measure.py` file name to see exactly which lines are missing from our tests. The colors indicate which
lines are covered (in green) and which are not. We can see that in our `calculate_angle` function, the return value in
radians is never checked by our tests. Let's go ahead and fix that by writing a new test.

> ## Exercise
> Write a new test in `tests/test_measure.py` to check that `calculate_angle` returns the
> correct value when `degrees=False`. Then run `pytest` again to update the coverage report.
>> ## Solution
>> ~~~
>> def test_calculate_angle_radians():
>>     """Test the calculate_angle function with output in radians"""
>> 
>>     r1 = np.array([1, 0, 0])
>>     r2 = np.array([0, 0, 0])
>>     r3 = np.array([0, 1, 0])
>> 
>>     expected_value = 90 * (np.pi / 180)
>> 
>>     calculated_value = molecool.calculate_angle(r1, r2, r3)
>>     assert expected_value == calculated_value
>> ~~~
>> {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

If you refresh the coverage page on your browser (or re-open it if you closed it before), you will see that
`measure.py` now has 100% coverage.

### Adding code coverage to your CI workflow

Besides running tests for you, GitHub can interface with other services to help you get reports on code coverage. In
this last section, we will introduce
[Codecov](https://codecov.io/), one of many services that was created to help developers assess which areas of their
projects lack sufficient test coverage. Codecov is free for open-source projects and integrates very nicely with GitHub.

On your browser, navigate again to the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) and this time, select the
category
`Code quality`. Find and click on `Codecov`, and on the following page install the `Open Source` plan. You can choose to
add CodeCov to your accout here, and you can choose either to add it to all repositories or to slect repositories. After
going through the install process, you will be redirected to codecov.io where you should log in with your GitHub Accout.

Once on the `Codecov` web page, notice that `molecool` is already in your repositories and it already has results to
show you. How is this possible?

The last line step of our `CI.yml` configuration file is a call to an executable called `codecov`. The CookieCutter
includes this utility program and sets it up automatically for us. As a result, when our CI workflow runs successfully (
all tests pass), GitHub Actions runs `codecov`, which send statistics of our test coverage automatically to Codecov.io.
Neat!

Back to the Codecov `molecool` report page, the sunburst plot gives a hierachical view of our project and its coverage.

<br />
<center><img src="../fig/08_CI/codecov_screenshot.png"></center>
<br />

Red areas represent code that is poorly covered by our tests. On the right, you see the latest commits and can click on
each one of them to see how they changed overall coverage of the project. It is possible, although outside the scope of
this episode, to setup Travis to fail if a commit lowers the coverage of our codebase. The bottom of the page shows a
simple file-browser like interface, much like the HTML page we obtained before.

## Modifying the Workflow - Adding an Action

A great feature of GitHub Actions is that they are modular. Anyone can make an action and it can be plugged into someone
else's workflow if it is available on the GitHub Marketplace. This means that if you ever need to do something which is
something that may be commonly done, you should check the GitHub Marketplace to see if anyone has made this action
before.

Let's see how this works by adding a silly action to our workflow. Let's say we want a job on our workflow to print some
ASCII art our GHA Log. Searching the GitHub Marketplace, you might
find [this action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ascii-art-action) which generates ASCII art from text.

> ## Exercise - Adding an Action to our Workflow
> 
> Implement this [ASCII Art
> Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ascii-art-action) as **another
> job** in your workflow. Make it print your package name. Note that this Action

> see a failure of your job if you try to run on another operating system.
